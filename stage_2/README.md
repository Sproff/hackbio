# 🚀 Functions Galore!

Welcome to **Functions Galore!** In this project, you'll implement various Python functions related to **bioinformatics**, **population modeling**, and **string analysis**. Each function tackles a different computational challenge, making this a great exercise in writing efficient and meaningful code.

## 📌 Tasks

### 🧬 1. Translate DNA to Protein

Write a function that converts a **DNA sequence** into a **protein sequence** by:

- Transcribing **DNA → mRNA**
- Translating **mRNA → Protein** using the standard codon table

### 📈 2. Simulate Logistic Population Growth

Write a function that **simulates and generates a logistic growth curve**, modeling population dynamics. Your function should:

- Include **two extra parameters** to randomize the length of the **lag phase** and **exponential phase**.
- Follow a **logistic growth model** where the population follows an **S-shaped curve**.
- Represent growth as **Population Size vs Time**, **Cell Density vs Time**, **OD vs Time**, **CFU vs Time**, etc.

Use the logistic growth function to generate **100 different growth curves** and store them in a **DataFrame** (or another structured format of your choice).

### ⏳ 3. Determine Time to 80% of Maximum Growth

Write a function that determines the **time required** for the population to reach **80% of the carrying capacity (K)**.

### 🔢 4. Calculate Hamming Distance

Write a function that calculates the **Hamming distance** between:

- Your **Slack username**
- Your **Twitter/X handle** (or a synthesized one if you don’t have one)

📌 **Note:** If the strings are **not the same length**, pad them with extra words or characters.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Use **pure Python** (no external libraries unless necessary).
- Ensure the code is **well-documented**, **efficient**, and **readable**.
