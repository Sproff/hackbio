# Functions Galore!  

## Tasks  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Translate DNA to Protein  
Write a function that converts a **DNA sequence** into a **protein sequence** by:  
- Transcribing **DNA ‚Üí mRNA**  
- Translating **mRNA ‚Üí Protein** using the codon table  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulate Logistic Population Growth  
Write a function that **generates a logistic growth curve**, simulating population dynamics. The function should:  
- Include **two extra parameters** to randomize the **lag phase** and **exponential phase** durations  
- Follow a **logistic growth model**, where the population follows a **sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve**  
- Model growth as **Population Size vs Time**, **Cell Density vs Time**, **OD vs Time**, **CFU vs Time**, etc.  

üìå **Reference:** [Logistic Growth Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate 100 Growth Curves  
Use the logistic growth function to generate a **dataset with 100 different growth curves**.  
Store the results in a **DataFrame** (or a structured format of your choice).  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Determine Time to 80% of Maximum Growth  
Write a function that determines the **time required** for the population to reach **80% of the carrying capacity** (K).  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Hamming Distance  
Write a function that calculates the **Hamming distance** between:  
- Your **Slack username**  
- Your **Twitter/X handle** (or a synthesized one if you don‚Äôt have one)  

üìå **Note:** If the strings are **not the same length**, pad them with extra words or characters.  

---

## üõ† Submission  
- Implement the functions in **pure Python** (no external libraries unless necessary).  
- Ensure the code is **readable**, **well-documented**, and **efficient**.  

üöÄ **Happy Coding!**
